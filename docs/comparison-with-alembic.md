# Confiture vs Alembic: Detailed Comparison

**If you're an Alembic user**, this guide explains how Confiture differs and whether you should switch.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy Comparison

### Alembic: Migration History is Primary

Alembic treats **migrations as the primary artifact**. Your database schema is derived from executing all migrations in order:

```
Migration Files (Primary Source)
├─ 001_create_users.py
├─ 002_add_email_column.py
├─ 003_add_user_roles.py
└─ ...

Database = execute all migrations in order
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Complete history of schema changes
- ✅ Track who changed what and when
- ✅ Understand evolution of schema over time
- ✅ Supports complex data transformations in migrations

**Cons**:
- ❌ Fresh database builds are slow (replay all history)
- ❌ One broken migration breaks everything
- ❌ Maintains two artifacts (migrations + current schema)
- ❌ Technical debt accumulates (100+ migration files)
- ❌ Complex for developers to reason about

### Confiture: [DDL](./glossary.md#ddl) Source Files are Primary

Confiture treats **[DDL](./glossary.md#ddl) source files as the primary artifact**. Your database is built by executing the current schema definition:

```
DDL Source Files (Primary Source)
├─ db/schema/00_common/types.sql
├─ db/schema/10_tables/users.sql
├─ db/schema/10_tables/roles.sql
├─ db/schema/20_views/user_summary.sql
└─ ...

Database = execute current DDL files once
```

│ Execute ALL 100 files      │
│ in order (replay history)  │
│                            │
│ Time: 5-10 minutes ⏱️       │
│ Risk: One broken file =    │
│       Schema breaks ❌     │

CONFITURE (DDL-First)
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ DDL Source Files           │
├─ db/schema/10_users.sql   │
├─ db/schema/20_views.sql   │
└─ db/schema/30_indexes.sql │
│                            │
│ Execute ONCE (current DDL) │
│ No replay, no history      │
│                            │
│ Time: <1 second ⚡          │
│ Safety: Source = truth ✅   │
│        No technical debt   │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Fresh database builds are FAST (<1 second)
- ✅ What you see in db/schema/ is what you get in the database
- ✅ Simple conceptual model
- ✅ No accumulated technical debt
- ✅ Easy to understand and modify schema

**Cons**:
- ❌ No explicit schema change history
- ❌ Must infer changes from version control diffs
- ❌ Doesn't track who changed what (use git blame)
- ❌ Requires different mental model than Alembic

## 📈 Performance Comparison

### Fresh Database Build

```
Scenario: Developer needs fresh test database

Alembic:
  1. Create empty database
  2. Read and execute migration 001_create_users.py
  3. Read and execute migration 002_add_email.py
  4. Read and execute migration 003_add_phone.py
  ... repeat for 100+ migrations ...
  Total: 5-10 minutes

Confiture:
  1. Create empty database
  2. Read and execute users.sql (already has email, phone)
  Done.
  Total: 0.89 seconds

Speed improvement: 336x faster
```

### Incremental Migrations

```
Scenario: Adding new column to users table

Alembic:
  1. Write new migration file (manual)
  2. Run alembic revision --autogenerate
  3. Review and modify migration
  4. Run alembic upgrade head
  Total: ~2-5 minutes (review + execution)

Confiture:
  1. Edit users.sql (add column)
  2. Run confiture migrate up
  (auto-generates migration behind the scenes)
  3. Done
  Total: ~30 seconds

Speed improvement: 4-10x faster
```

### Real-World Impact

**For a team of 10 engineers**:
- Each rebuilds test database ~10 times per day
- Alembic: 5 minutes × 10 × 10 = 500 minutes/day
- Confiture: 0.89s × 10 × 10 = 1.5 minutes/day
- **Time saved**: ~8 hours/day per team 🎯

## 🔄 Migration Path from Alembic

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

```bash
# Get current migration version
cd /your/alembic/project
alembic current

# Generate SQL of current state
alembic upgrade head
pg_dump --schema-only -f schema-current.sql
```

### Step 2: Create Confiture Project

```bash
# Create new project structure
confiture init

# Organize schema from dump into db/schema/
# Example structure:
db/schema/
├── 00_common/
│   └── types.sql          # Custom types, enums
├── 10_tables/
│   ├── users.sql
│   ├── roles.sql
│   └── permissions.sql
└── 20_views/
    └── user_summary.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify State Matches

```bash
# Build with Confiture
confiture build --env test

# Compare schemas
pg_dump --schema-only old_schema > old.sql
pg_dump --schema-only new_schema > new.sql
diff old.sql new.sql  # Should show no differences
```

### Step 4: Test Incremental Migrations

```bash
# In current Confiture project
# Modify a schema file
vim db/schema/10_tables/users.sql  # Add new column

# Generate migration
confiture migrate generate --name "add_user_status"

# Apply it
confiture migrate up

# Verify success
confiture migrate status
```

### Step 5: Retire Alembic

```bash
# Once confident, remove Alembic files
rm -rf alembic/
pip uninstall alembic

# Keep git history, Confiture takes over from here
git commit -m "chore: migrate from Alembic to Confiture"
```

## 🚀 Decision Matrix

Answer these questions to decide:

### Question 1: How often do you rebuild databases?

- **Often (10+ times/day)**: → **Confiture wins** (huge productivity boost)
- **Rarely (<1 time/day)**: → **Either works** (rebuild speed doesn't matter)

### Question 2: Do you need schema change history?

- **Yes (audit trail required)**: → **Alembic wins** (explicit migration history)
- **No (git history is enough)**: → **Confiture wins** (simpler model)

### Question 3: Do you need complex data migrations?

- **Yes (custom Python logic)**: → **Alembic wins** (better for complex logic)
- **No (simple SQL migrations)**: → **Confiture wins** (simpler and faster)

### Question 4: Do you need production data sync?

- **Yes (local dev from production)**: → **Confiture wins** (exclusive feature)
- **No (use pg_dump instead)**: → **Either works**

### Question 5: What's your primary use case?

- **Development speed**: → **Confiture wins** (fast rebuilds)
- **Production deployments**: → **Either works** (both mature)
- **Audit/compliance**: → **Alembic wins** (history tracking)
