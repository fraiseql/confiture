## 🚨 If There Are Issues

### Issue: Can't find qualified reviewer for a role

**Solution**:
- Ask for recommendations from others
- Consider lower priority roles first (timeline/resource is more flexible)
- Extend search to external contacts

### Issue: Reviewer declines

**Solution**:
- Have backup person for each role
- Ask for referrals from person who declined
- Extend invitation to backup immediately

### Issue: Reviewer unavailable for meeting on Dec 31

**Solution**:
- Offer Jan 1 instead
- Or allow written feedback if truly unavailable
- Include them in meeting notes/summary

### Issue: Running short on time

**Solution**:
- Fast-track process if needed
- Can compress timeline (reviews + meeting Dec 30-31)
- Last resort: extend to Jan 2-3 but impacts Phase 5 start

## ⏱️ Timeline Sensitivity

**Critical Path Item**: All reviewers must be identified and invited by EOD Dec 28

- ✅ If done on time: Review on schedule (Dec 29-Jan 2)
- ⚠️ If delayed 1 day: Review slips to Dec 30-Jan 3
- ❌ If delayed 2+ days: Phase 5 start may slip from Jan 2

**Your Impact**: Tomorrow's 2-3 hours of work determines whether Phase 5 starts on time.
